PSEUDO CODDES
1. Display the HTML form with input fields for name, email, phone, password, and confirm password.
2. When the form is submitted:
    a. Retrieve the form data (POST method).
    b. Validate each field:
        i. Check if name, email, phone, password, and confirm password fields are not empty.
        ii. Validate email format.
        iii. Validate phone number format.
        iv. Check if password and confirm password fields match.
        v. Optionally, check for additional validation rules like password strength.
    c. If any validation fails:
        i. Display error messages next to the respective fields.
        ii. Re-populate the form fields with the user's input.
    d. If all validation passes:
        i. Process the form data (e.g., store in a database, send via email, etc.).
        ii. Redirect the user to a success page or display a success message.
3. Optionally, use client-side validation (JavaScript) for a better user experience.
